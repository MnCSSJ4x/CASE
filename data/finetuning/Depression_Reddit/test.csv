"Random girl asked me awful question today.
I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. 

I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I’ve had my highs and my lows. Recently I’ve been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we’re still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that. 

Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?”  That’s when my heart sank. 

I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home.  I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. 

I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that. 

Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile. I don’t know if this is the right sub for this either, I just needed to get this off my chest. ",1
"I started hurting myself tonight...
I've never done it before, but I just can't deal with the mental pain anymore.  I'm trying to distract myself with physical pain.  It's weird how it makes you think about that rather than how shitty things are...I guess it's temporary relief, but it helps.",1
"HELP! my friend invited herself along to a romantic holiday i was in the process of planning with my boyfriend.
I (19, F) flat with my boyfriend (19, M) and best friend (19, F).  Yesterday i bought up that me and my boyfriend were wanting to go to Aus at the end of the year in the summer as a treat. my friend jumped at this and was saying how much she'd love to go to aus as well, and how great it would be if we all went together. i have to admit i was kind of encouraging her, and talking about what we would do and how much fun it would be etc. but now she's looking at flights and hotels and asking me so many questions about it when actually i want this trip to be a thing that me and my boyfriend do, as a romantic holiday. i love my friend and it would be a lot of fun with her there but i also want this to be special and intimate with my boyfriend. we want to do our own things together. i feel so bad about this i don't want to end up ditching her or for her to feel like she's not wanted. how do i tell her this??? how do i make it clear that this isn't a friend group holiday, this is a romantic holiday for me and my bf. Tbh i wouldn't mind her coming to aus with us on the same flight and doing stuff with her there/meeting up with her to do fun stuff there....but she wants to book a hotel &amp; everything for all of us.

"Please someone read this, i've been holding so well since my dad died but now...
I feel like killing myself is sooner or later inevitable.

I came back home from my boyfriend's house because I think I should spend some time with my mom. My dad's death made me speak what I feel and even stopped suicidal thoughts. But today.... I decided to be honest about few things unregarded to my dad.  Now mind you, me and my mom has always had rocky relationship and I would never tell her much. 
Now I reminded myself why... Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day.
An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I'm shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and... Hatred... 
One of my coworkers told me ""don't do anything you have no strength for, don't push yourself, everyone grieves differently"". She's the only person that understands me... I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She's such a kind person...
But not... I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that's too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there's nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I won't get it from mom, I feel like I won't get it from boyfriend.

"How to get over my ex best friend
Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :( ",0

"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love
Dear (future) B,

This letter may be fragmented.

This letter may be short, or it may be long. 

This letter may be emotional. 

Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. 

Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It’s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you’ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. 

As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.” 

Listen to me: You are not validated by someone’s ability (or lack thereof) to love you. 

And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. 

So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for. 

As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. 

You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. 

When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder. 

When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. 

Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. 

Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. 

You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first.  

Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life. 

Love yourself.
Respect yourself.
Appreciate your own time.
Respect others.
Respect other’s need for space. 
Live for you.
Again, love yourself. 


With love,
B, 12/3/2017.

"Can't relate or make friends with anyone my age
19 years old, just got out of highschool. Anyways, I'm a chill dude, good looking, and sociable. Anyways, I have trouble making any fucking friends with dudes my age (no trouble with girls). I'll vibe with them really well at first and play sports or whatever with a few of them. They seem pretty friendly but at the same time some of their other friends seem to kind of hate me even though they act polite when interacting with me. I can even hear them talk shit sometimes from a distance even tho there's no personal beef and most of them haven't spoken more than a sentence to me b4? however they won't directly confront me and at least be upfront. Literally even in highschool I'd have dudes try to test me and start shit with me though I didnt even know them lol fuck this shit, is every kid my age a fuck boy? I met a few chill ppl, but damn most of them seem like insecure cunts...it's just making me hate ppl more and myself more.",1

"does it ever feel like your friends arent really there?
I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. 
But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing.
I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to..",1
"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all?
Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then.

After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know.",1
"My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him
I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services.

He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up.

It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him.",0
"Feeling trapped in my head
First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.  

So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. 

Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. 

I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) 

Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. 

When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy. ",1

"I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him.
Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good.

With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do?

Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance.",0

"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?)
**TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? 


**Long Story (detailed)**:   
      
   My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. 
      

  Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. 
      In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. 
      

   A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck.
       

On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. 
   

  *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she ""gives"" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*

"I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do.
One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.

I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend. I just don't know what to do, she usually doesn't listen to me anyways. I don't know, maybe I am just a dirtbag.

I have these feelings not only at night when I'm alone but when I'm with friends and I know that they don't understand it because I get the normal response of ""everybody feels that way man."" and that's just a worse thing for me to think about. if everyone has it I must be a failure for letting it affect me in such a way where I cant get anything done for school and I just sit on my computer all day.

"my cousin
Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence.

"Hosted my sister’s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day
Hi Reddit! I’m wondering if I’m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and we’re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom.

So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a “here you go, bye.”

The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, “what should we do today kids??” To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriend’s husband’s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that they’d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. 

My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her.

I didn’t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didn’t want to watch the game with them, and I’d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it.

Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so “selfish” and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say I’m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy.

I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable""
Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

"I need to get my life on track
Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.",1
"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted
I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible.

I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world.

I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done.

Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? 

That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for.

I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me. ",1
"Why my relationship is killing me
Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.

This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship.
I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.

I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.

Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.

We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.

However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now.
I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.

So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone).
I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.

Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.

In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"".

She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.

I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes.
We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes.
She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.

I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.

But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.

However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.

She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.

She didn't speak to me for two weeks.

When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.

Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices.
Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.

She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.

This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers!
All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.

Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me.
She set me up, just to rip out my heart.

Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.

But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into.
She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.

Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.

So why this post?
Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.

Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard.
I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?

Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility).

All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.",1
"My mother and her tragically unlucky family
Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance.

My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go;

So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two.

But it gets unluckier.

So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later)

1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that).

But again, it gets unluckier.

Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal.

So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family.

So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was.

So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband.

I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born.

The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff.

So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?

"Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now
Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!

Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. 

For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable. 

I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. 

She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted!

It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. 

Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. 

Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?",0
"It's become a personality trait
Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences. I know we have one life and that there's nothing after that but that fact isn't motivating. In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous. ",1
"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in
I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems.

I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me. 

When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. 

I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. 

Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I'm so lost and sad and pathetic",1

But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol.

"Are my struggles even legitimate? [rant]
I have been wondering that for a long wile, after a friend told me that there life had been worse so I had no right to be the way I am.

And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? 


Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! 

Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! 


I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! 


Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! 

Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn’t make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! 


Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! 


I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know

"Abnormal
I'm so used to being depressed and anxious I'm amazed how people can act normally in general. I'm like how do they do it? I'm so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere don't have to deal with this everyday and just can ""be themselves"" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people don't understand. I've met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you're overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I can't explain it but its killing me.

In her teens, she began following the mainstream, wearing the latest fashion. Always wearing makeup and black n white clothing. She craves luxury, but she's not bitchy. She's kind and generous. 

I like alternative styles. I love spiritually, and science of developing a healthy and peaceful mind. I don't have a need to be like everyone else. I LIKE to be childish.

Hi there,

I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me.

I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real ""talk therapy"". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to ""get into"" that again after the experience.

"friendship over wedding
im Not sure if it is appropriate to end a friendship because I wasn’t invited to a wedding but everyone else in the group of friends were and I didn’t even know about it. She did not even bother telling me. This was a very special friend to me and I would tell her everything about me back in college and she was the most important person to me. I tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc. but she would hardly ever respond. It seemed as if I was making much more of an effort than she was. When I found out that I wasn’t invited but everyone else in our group was, she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand. She did tell me that I was on her list of people she wanted etc. when I found out, because she was that important to me, I couldn’t eat, sleep or study for my liscening boards for over a week. I lost seven pounds over one week, I called my psychologist a couple of times, cried endlessly. And it really hurt to know that maybe we weren’t as close as we once were. I am not sure if you can understand how I really felt. I’m not even sure if it’s appropriate to place it in a thread like this. I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation?

"Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind?
Hello, 28 male. I'll try to be as brief as possible. I've never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I'm the one helping) but I've never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn't my sister I would've never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that's being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won't speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says ""well, he wants to sleep"" but won't go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: ""well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You'll see when you have one, ha ha"". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She's the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say ""I didn't get to clean the house this weekend"". Well guess what? She didn't get to clean the house too, because of the kid. ""Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven't done that in a while now. But you really can't, once you have a kid. You'll see"". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don't know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid's sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don't really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don't want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister's answer? ""Oh, they'll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I'll see them when they have a kid"" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can't handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if  get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don't want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I'm kinda sick of it and lost! I really can't tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will take my criticism as an adult. I'm really thinking of seeing a specialist seeking an advices and peace of mind.

"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try
I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth.

We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me.

I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. 

It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. 

I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting. ",0

"A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression
The letter you always wanted to write...

Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes.

Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box  and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse?

You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand.

Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn’t tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success.

I wish you all the happiness you deserve.

Love you, babe.

"God damn it I'm fucking done. I just suck at everything.
I give up. I fucking quit. I cant handle this world I'm too god damn weak. I don't want to go to school, I can't fucking do it. I haven't even registered but classes start in a few hours and now I need to go beg to be let in why do I do this shit to myself. I'm freaking out god damn it I'm running out of time and I keep digging myself deeper into my lies. I just want to cry all day but I can't even cry anymore. I lay in bed all day imagining a better world and a better me that will never come. I'm scared I'll always be disconnected from myself. I don't want to let my family down so I need to keep going to school but fuck I'm gonna fail and either way I'm gonna get kicked out I don't know what to do. And even worse I keep getting told I need to go get a job. My family aready view me as the stupid let down, and not having a job proves it to them. Everyone just thinks I'm lazy and I am because when I come here I see the real shit others have to deal with and my problems are all in my head. Am I sick or just lazy as fuck? And does it even matter? I cant put my feelings into words. Everytime I think things are looking up, I just get shit on. I want to erase myself from history. Everyone else would be so much better off god damn it I'm such a drain. Why do good people have to die while I'm still around? Just take me instead. I'm debating between driving to school in a few hours to try and get the classes I know I'll fail, or just driving off a fucking bridge. I'm sorry for taking attention away from everyone else here who are worse off than my pathetic confused ass, I just needed to do someting to get these feeling out or I'm gonna blow up and scream",1

"My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden.
Let's call my cousin Bobby.

My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week.
I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze.

I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. 

All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze. ",0
"Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between...
So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. 

One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward!

My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. 

I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway.",0
"I’ve been abandoned by anyone I’ve ever loved.
My mother emptied the bank accounts and left while I was in school one day, 20 years ago. A few years later, my father followed suit, getting sent to prison and never contacting me again. My brother lives across the country, haven’t spoken to him in years. Sister actually lives a few miles away, haven’t spoken to her in months. 

And recently my girlfriend of 4 years, who I was planning on proposing to, left without any warning, not even a talk. 

I haven’t spoken out loud to another human, barring work hours, in 3 weeks. I received my last non work related text 2 weeks ago. 

I keep trying to keep going, but I want to give up. I want to feel nothing. I don’t want to cry anymore.

"Help me figure this out
So I’m a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court I’d allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ?

"Little sister has depression, what do I do?
As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well. 

She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist. 
My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?

"My family might break apart...
Sorry this is a long post.
Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together.

Just to start off,
There is me, my brother, my dad and mum.

So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention.
We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.”
I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money.

My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. 

My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really.

And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better.
I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. 

So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her.
My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again.
So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”.  After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. 

Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think? 
And my mum is right, what can we do? 

There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. 
I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad.

We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad.
We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing.

So, what choices do we have?

"My parents’ living room is not large enough...
My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall it’s been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch.

Sister begged to get the “comfortable chair”. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sister’s devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. 

I am exhausted - it’s been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I haven’t had much sleep. I’d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but I’m just too exhausted. I don’t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I don’t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but I’m just not interested. I especially don’t want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I don’t care about, with a dead phone battery.

So I’m in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half.

This is a small thing compared to most of the posts on this board. But dear heaven, I’m tired... ",0
"Zoloft made me fly off the handle
I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry.

I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD. I’m better now however as this was 5 years ago. I cringe whenever I remember it however.",1

I've been losing parts of myself until all that's left of me is misery.  All I feel like doing anymore is laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling or if I'm feeling particularly bad I cut myself.

Ever since I was put into foster care, all I ever wanted was to bring my family together again. I wanted to build a future good enough to stay with my mother again.  


Instead I graduated with a shitty degree, no future, more debt than I can handle, and no real way to start improving this future. I'm 30 years old and I still cry myself to sleep thinking about my mom and all the pain she is in. I think about how much of a failure I've become and I wish I had never existed.  


She had a choice to get rid of me and choose not to thinking something good might come of this. My very existence not only ruined her life but gave myself no future or desire to live in the first place. So why am I still here? I just want it to end. I just want to see her one more time and then let it all end.",1
"I want to share a personal project I'm proud of
A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything.

Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful.

One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression.

What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood.

Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it.

Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :)

(Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)",1
"Apologise and make up or move on?
Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice.

I’m a girl and he’s a gay guy so there’s definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said ‘no you’re staying at mine tonight’, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didn’t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesn’t even text me, because apparently he’s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as ‘one of his best friends’, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day.

He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if I’d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didn’t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time we’ve hung out outside of a club, and he said ‘it’s not my fault I’m busy’. I didn’t show it but I was really disappointed. He’s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me he’s too busy for me.

A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. It’s also strange because he’d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was ‘tired and sick’ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said ‘ok’ because I didn’t want to confront him and fall out. 

On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‘are you still up for the cinema?’ and following advice from my friends, I said ‘no thanks’ and told him it’s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he’s not busy, he’s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I’m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he’s trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didn’t reply. 

It’s been 4 days and we haven’t spoken since. He’s been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I don’t think he’s bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but I’ve barely slept since. I’m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and I’m really sad and can’t stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says I’ve given him too many chances. I’ve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I don’t know how it will be received or if anything will change. I don’t know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place. If anyone has even read this, thank you",0

"Is this my distorted reality?
Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend.

Situation One
There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues...

I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help.  

SCENARIO TWO
I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?",0
"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!

I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:

Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.

I dont know how i feel or what to say.
I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? 
Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?

Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.

"Something i wrote during one of crying fits
Bridges were burned

Yet my heart it still yearns

Lessons were learned

Inside I still burn 

Not a flame of love, nor an ember of passion

A blue flame lit, reminiscent of what I'm lacking

A lonely lit candle that pains my insides

Those tears of mine dried up, no longer can I cry

New year, I'm out of luck, anxious and somber here I lie

I scratch and I scratch, yet numbness blocks out the feeling

There's no way to patch up, I'm broken glass I'm far from healing

Empty conversations with people I could not care less about

I envy healthy relationships, ones that I could not have, no doubt

Eyeballs that cannot weep and screams without sounds

I'm still depressed when people are around

Yet I'm hard to read, I'm one to bleed

Waste time as I scroll through my social feeds

Waste hours as thoughts take over and I can't sleep

"I have a bad personality that appears good.
My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others.

TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.",1
"I feel like I'm in a rut. I don't like it here.
First post here, so here we go

Like the title says, I feel like I am in a rut. I am tired 100% of the time, regardless of the sleep I have had (quality, length, etc). Feel simultaneously under-utilized and under-qualified for my job at the moment. I don't feel like I am doing anything worth-while, but I also don't even feel qualified to do even this job. 

When I get home, all I want to do is either sleep or sit in front of my computer. When I am on my computer, I never do anything productive, just get into YouTube holes that last forever. I try to be creative; maybe try game design, or start writing; but it all just falls flat and I feel worse, not good enough. 

I have no real friends (not including work acquaintances, who all have their own lives to live) in my area, all of them are online, and again, they all have their own lives too. 

I feel unimportant, I feel un-unique (is this even a word? words are hard), I feel exhausted. I don't know what to do. Even now I feel stupid for writing this on the freaking Depression subreddit.

I just feel alone.",1

"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay
It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. 
Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends.

My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. 

I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media.

Hello everyone and happy new lunar year! 

Here is my story: I just came back from a casino joined by my family members only, we were having a great time together and everybody were well entertained. Things were smoothly going until I committed a foul as a result of my lack of understanding about a certain kind of  gambling. Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault.

I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned.

Bottom line is: Their lifestyles, comments to me, comments about my kids, bad tempers, alcohol intake, drug use, and pasts instill in me no confidence that they can be responsible caretakers of my daughter.

I hear so many stories of child abuse -- sexual abuse, especially. From family members, most often. I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. I'm not afraid to offend my in-laws. But other family members say I'm being unreasonable.

I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were ""like they were in freshman year"" and that he ""should have never lied to them"".

"Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life.
I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young.
Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other.
We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up.
The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home.
 They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. 

But as always we came back together and were just like old times, 
I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world.

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with
Warning: Super long read

Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with?

It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.

I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.

There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.

Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.",1

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable?
TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves


I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. 

When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. 

Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me. 

She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it.

"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning
So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job.

So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". 

Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. 

Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. 

Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around.

So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. 

Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. 

She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst.

So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends.

Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there.

So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go check on her"" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama. 

Afterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn't have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she's like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn't know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it. 

I don't want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It's just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don't know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving. ",0

HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.

Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.",1
"I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation
I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i haven't applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted.
Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there's something ""wrong"" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. 
I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i can't get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to do",1
"Why is it that I forget information about certain people?

Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)

I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. 

I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 

1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to.

2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 

3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on)

4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me.

5.) I don't open up to people easily.

6.) My social life is spent more online.

7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days)

8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 

9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety.

10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers.

11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job.

12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 

13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion)

14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them.

15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize.

16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons.

17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously


I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able)

Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy.

Example: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. 
She also love chinese as much as I do. 

C loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy.


I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people.

Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. 

TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.",0
"I Dont Know
I would die if you guys could all go back to your original former or happy selves and stay there. I think I've been making a breakthrough lately. But i still think ive taken more L's in life than a lot of people I see or pass by. Why me? Why this? Guys why do i have go through so much pain in life? Why did I have to witness little boys get bullied, my mom getting beaten to a pulp by some drunk, why do I have to see all of this?

I'm at the end of high school and soon have to decide on what school i want next but i don't want to work in the future, as i would just always feel like shit, be under pressure or whatever

Life is just shit, and I don't see why i should continue",1
"I've really hit a new low
I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing.

I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining.

I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything!

But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired.

I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal.

I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head.

Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams.",1

My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object.
I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life.

"Help, I'm not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward.
A little background on my partner and our relationship, he's 23 and I'm 21. He lost his mother to sickness when he was 17 years old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he was back home but he currently studies overseas to complete his bachelor's degree. However, he's been home for the past 2.5 weeks as he is having his semester break.

We began dating a year and 2 months ago. He's been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I've ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little things and is very physically affectionate. However for the past 2.5 weeks, he's been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday (4 days ago).

We had planned to meet at 2pm, but at 2pm he asks if we can meet at 5pm because 'the weather is too hot'. Fair enough, so we decide to meet at 5pm.

When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and does not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he lets me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He's looking out the window and he doesn't want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he orders one tiny dish and doesn't want to eat anymore because he has no appetite. I asked him what's wrong and he said he's just tired. I asked if he's angry at me and he says no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he doesn't want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smiles all of 2 times while we're out.

We then decide to head to a bar (his decision, even though I told him I'm okay with going home), but we just drank our beers in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he was disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I've been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tells me that he's tired and it's got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he's back home but he doesn't. It's been 4 days since then and I texted him last night but to no response (it's been 24 hours).

Other reasons why I think he may be depressed are:- A week before he came home, he found out his dog of 13 years passed away.

\- He has a very erratic sleep schedule. He'll sleep at 5am, wake up at noon.

\- He doesn't want to do things that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we'll go 'next week' but that hasn't happened yet.

\- We haven't had sex in a week.

\- He hasn't met his best friend of a few years even though he's been home for 2.5 weeks.

\- He hasn't made contact with me for 4 days, this is out of the ordinary.

\- He's totally checked out of social media, not stayed up to date with memes and Instagram stories (with the only exception being last night when he watched my Instagram story)

\- His Instagram and Twitter bio is ""Have fun. Be kind. Die."" (!!!!)

I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to figure out what's going on. I don't know if this could be depression or if it's just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these signs are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he's leaving to go back to uni in a few days but I don't know when I'll be able to see him again.

I don't know how to reach out to him, he didn't respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation. Please give me any advice you can on how to go about dealing with the situation. I love him so much and I want to support him, but I don't know how.",1
"Feel like I have no right to feel this way
People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. 

I hate using the term “depressed”. Even as I’m writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It’s being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I’m just being a little bitch that uses it like I don’t know it. 

Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I’m not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they aren’t the best medicine for me. 

Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then I’m back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up. Then I lay down, and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts.

Sorry for the rant. Today was a shitty day and I had to let it out somehow...

"Is my friend acting dumb?
So, my friend has been dating this guy for a couple of years. Not only did he cheat on her but he got another woman pregnant. She found nudes of other girls on his phone. They broke up, got back together, etc. Hes been trying to prove hes changed to her... blah blah. 
My friend told me to create a fake profile of an attractive woman and talk to him and he unfortunately failed. He said he was single and willing to meet this said woman

He is currently oversees with family. He is notorious for going to strip clubs and getting wasted. 

It is halloween weekend and my friend and I are newly single and freshly 21 and we have not gone out. She says she doesnt want to because he knows hes not very faithful but she can't do the same. She's literally going to break up with him the next day. 

Now.. I have no one to go to the party with LOL

"Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it's making me feel less inclined to reciprocate.
So. I'm going to use fake names for these people instead of referring to them as mere pronouns. 

Me = The CrazyCOKids

Orlando = The guy who is badgering me because, well, Orlando *is* the name of a character in Redwall who is a badger. 

Grath = Second person

Fallow = Someone else, mutual friend of all of ours. 


So. Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*. Like, all the time someone else I'll refer to as Fallow wants to do something with me or Grath. 

Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously. 

See, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being ""by association"". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings 'em along? yeah.) We basically don't wanna just be ""Orlando's friend"" or ""Grath's buddy"", or ""Crazy's friend"" to each other. So we're intentionally doing some things with each other. 

Orlando, however, wants to be included in *everything*, and thinks that if people are doing something without him, he's being excluded intentionally and maliciously. So at first we didn't mention what we were doing, because Orlando would come in private and ask ""You going to do me next?"" or start going all ""Oh nobody ever thinks to include me I'm always the one left out"" or starts trying to guilt-trip us. But then, well, that obviously made him think that we were hiding stuff from him. Whenever we went to him first (and boy do we ever) he doesn't complain, and frankly it seems like we really shouldn't have to run everything through him because we're not in grade school still and you know, oftentimes if we *do* run it past him and ask if he would like to get involved he complains that he feels like 'the third wheel' or 'like we're just including him to be nice'. :/ 

Then he decides to start harassing us asking if we'll include him in things, essentially demanding we do things to him to make it up, then doing things like ""I just want to be included so then I can at least enjoy this thing"". So he guilt-trips us with how bad his (admittedly shitty) homelife is to try and get us to do things one-on-one with him or give him gifts. 

Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen.

Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going ""Hey! Wait for me!"" but he doesn't seem to get it. ",0
"I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself
I’ve told a couple friends this. They’ve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I’m content with this thought? I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I’m content. Most of the time though I’m in a shitty mood.

I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better

With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck.

"Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy?
I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?",0

"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text]
One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides.

Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him.

Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: 

""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%!
 
I probably won't pay you the money.""

I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on.

I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money.

He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?

"I'm unsure of our friend status - it's making head go crazy and heart go ballistic
A few months earlier this year a friend of mine and I had dinner, we started talking about our personal lives - I've discovered things he went through and it hurt my heart to find out what he went through. He was able to open up to me and I felt privilegged to be that friend whom he's shared this with.

"What makes someone weird?
I've often been told by people (that like and don't like me alike) that I'm weird. I've become a guarded person because of it but I also embrace that others think of me as...unique. I am generally a confident person. I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive.

I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc). So, what makes someone weird?",0
"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself.
I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments.   
I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There's nothing to look forward to anymore.

My parents have argued pretty much my entire life, for at least 30 years. Every time I visit or see them interacting with each other involves loud, aggressive name-calling and tears.

I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone.

Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting).

I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term.

"No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me
I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. 

Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. 

I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further.

I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. 

I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope.",1

"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life?
I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September. 

When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.) 

Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. 

Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.

Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. 

So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood.

Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.


What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. 


No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. 

During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. 

The depression kinda spiraled out of control.

I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. 

My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.

I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. 

But despite all that, I want to kill die still.

I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. 

I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment.

And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. 

(My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants?
Okay so I’m going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I’ve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it’s been coming back.

I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.

"Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up
So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. 
POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this.
I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? 
Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? 
Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

"Should I have kids?
Here’s why I’m asking:
My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else.

I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.

"Trying to understand my depressed SO
I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective

So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good. 

When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me. 

This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking ""how are you questions"". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup.  Nothing. 

My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful.

So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns? Advice greatly appreciated. Thanks",1
"No lodging for the sad
Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.

Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy.

The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.",1

Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. 

I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. 

At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.

I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone",1
"My step brother came out to me while drinking and I'm not sure if he remembers
A few days ago we were pretty drunk, he more drunk than I, and he told me he sometimes finds men more attractive than women. He said he had never told anyone else that. I was very supportive and told him I was proud of him, but I'm not sure if he remembers having this conversation. He made sure to say multiple times that this is something he would want to talk about sober, but I'm worried that might have just been the alcohol talking. The topic hasn't come up since. I'm not sure if I should bring it up. I don't want to embarrass him or force him to come back out if he doesn't remember it, but I also am worried that he may remember it and be to embarrassed to bring it up himself. I just want him to know that I still love and accept him without making him feel awkward or pressured in any way. Can anyone help me out here?

tldr: step brother/best friend came out to me possibly black out, not sure if I should bring it up or not",0
"Backstabbing fake “Friend”
So just as me and my friend were getting closer my boyfriend sent her a dick pic. (Boyfriend thing is settled), but the friend thing not so much. She sent him partially clothed pictures, and she definitely has some sort of feelings for him. This happened a month ago and me and her haven’t talked about it much. She acts like nothing happened and she asks me for favors. I honestly hate her now but I’m pretending to like her to her face. How do I take the next step of ending our friendship a month in already?

"Need advice on a friendship!
Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first",0
"I'm so tired.
So tired of everything.

I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span.

 My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now.

One of my closest friends and unfortunately now ex-gf, not only do I still hate myself for how I was but I can't even bring myself to talk to her, I'm just a pathetic waste of a human.

All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally.

Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c.

There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy.

Just needed to get some thoughts out, I've gotten about 2 hours of sleep in the last 3 days and it's not for the lack of trying. I just wish I knew how to fix myself when I was still fixable.",1
"I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years
I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.

Please take me back to being a little girl again. Let me try again please.

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital
Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.

My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.

 Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.

I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.

I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. 

What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.",1
"My friend is dating my friend's rapist.
my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. 

Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her. Do you think I am doing the right thing or should I continue our friendship separately?

TLDR: My friend is dating my other friend's rapist. Am I overreacting by cutting off my friendship with her completely?",0
"I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend
Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off

While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc.

On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it

I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way.

Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off",0

"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live.
It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. 

All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.

I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.

I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.

I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me.

"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend
This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes.

This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse.

Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide.

During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc.

In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how.
I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems.

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence
Hi 

I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here.

Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago.

I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but  when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. 

However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. 
It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better.

Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me.

I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. 

I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression. 

That's the conclusion I came up with anyway

"What Depression is Like For Me.
Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult.

Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.

To pretend, nothing happened. ",1

"i'm circling the drain
i'm sorry if this is in the wrong place.

i feel like i'm at my limit

i'm trying to wait for health insurance to kick in from my fast food job. i hate this job. i like my co-workers, even though they think i'm weird. i'm trying so hard to get them to like me. i just want people to like me. people always said i was weird and made fun of me. i mean, thats like anyone else, i guess. 

i've always hated myself. always. i'm aware its probably internalized whatever from however many years of violent bullying and social isolation, but its to a point where my gf and roomate can see. i'm trying so hard to work this job and i'm smoking so much weed to cope and i get so anxious and have to talk to all these people and i'm always doing something weird and all i want to do is play Melee because its how i decompress (i do music as well but its shit), but i've developed thoracic outlet syndrome i guess from chest breathing for years and now my scalenes are fucked and everytime i play Melee i start chest breathing and i can't do the one thing i really want to do and i know thats pathetic, i can't quit my job because we need rent, i don't want to leave because i need health insurance so i can start going to therapy and possibly start physical therapy because my posture (forward head) is fucked. i don't talk to any of my friends. for some reason once they're not physically there i can't be a good friend. i lost my original best friend that way, socially defective. all i have is my gf and puppy and roommate and i flucuate between 'splitting' on them (because i possibly have bpd) and desperately wanting to avoid having them seeing everything wrong with me, they're all i have.

i don't mean to be an attention whore

i've always been this ugly, boring fucking unwanted piece of worm shit. my dad cheated on his wife with my mom. i knew he had left when i was young but i didn't know i was a mistake until my uncle told me, in so many words, the 'truth' about my birth, and how i'm lucky to be alive, and how she prolly should've aborted me (i was a spoiled, shit kid and he was trying to get my attention. honestly this story isn't even a big deal, though i did break down retelling it once. i'm filing it under just being high at the time). i kind of ruined my mother's life. kids never liked me either. in general, people only like me when i'm in full 'social camouflage'. i'm nice, witty, assertive, all the traits of normal folk. as soon as that camo starts to thin, and i start doing all my stupid retarded fucking worthless mannerisms, or sounds, or daydreaming, or opening my mouth to talk naturally about anything i want to at all, i'm outed. i've had my entire classroom laugh at me, more than once. my own friends, even by original bets friend, would make fun of me and call me ugly. i mean, again, nothing new, but just to paint a picture of whatever i guess i'm sorry

i wish i was prettier. i'm a guy but sometimes i wish i was a girl. i don't think its gender dysphoria, i just abhor my physical appearance. i can count on the fingers of one hand how many times ive looked into any kind of reflective surface.

i come from Christianity so i guess the idea of me possibly having depression is so surreal to me. i've thought of suicide nearly every day since this year's started. some days every hour. every minute. constantly. sometimes i daydream about it. sometimes the thoughts make me sad. sometimes i'm so mad at myself i want to make the thoughts a reality, blood and all. sometimes the thoughts get so bad, so gory and so tragic. i'm sorry i guess there's something wrong with me, i feel scared because i feel like i'm being pushed over the edge and i can't do anything about it. i talk to myself, in actual back and forth convos, completely with laughing and inside jokes and even some 'us' 'we' and the like pronouns thrown in (sounds like so many other internet posts lmao). it started as a imaginary friend, and just kinda went from there as I trimmed the fat. it helped. i've been so abysmally lonely most of my life. i have a gf and puppy now. she knows i'm depressed, but i can't tell her how much. i can't tell her that i scope out the highway water bridges for places i can park. or at least walk to. i'm trying so hard. on one hand i know what killing myself would do to her. but some times it gets so dark. sometimes it gets so bad i know she'll be overjoyed to see my corpse. sometimes i think about killing myself in front of her, or my co workers. i think about dying, every day, every minute, every second. i think about dying painfully. i'm smoking all the weed i can and i try not to think about it. i just tell myself i'm venting, mentally. i've never attempted. its just ideation.

"I just found my half sister &amp; half brother &amp; I'm super excited &amp; a bit down at the same time
I've known for many years about them, in fact my father (whom is their father as well, different mothers) was the one that told me I had a little sister, this was when I was around 10 yrs old or so. Since then I've chosen to put them in the back of my mind. My gf had asked me if I would ever look them up or would want to meet them, I just blahhed the question. So this past Sunday morning I typed in my last name on Facebook &amp; started snooping around. Voila, there was my half brother, voila, there was my half sister. No lie, I was extremely happy, &amp; extremely sad. My father had, has, is unfaithful to my mother. Because of that reason I had no interest in meeting my half family. Now I've run into my sister, she's 24 yrs old, super smart &amp; beautiful. I messaged her, we went back &amp; forth answering each other's questions. Now we are planning on meeting for the first time before she moves away across the country. It is a very God blessed situation that I am in. I always prayed to God that I would get a sister, (I am the eldest of three from both my dad &amp; mom, all three brothers) &amp; now God said, BAM, here you go. My sister seems like she is excited as well, I hope she is. Has anyone gone through something similar, have a similar life experience ? ",0
"Get myself to be more active/alive?
So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I'm in law school and I'm in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams.

I started last october. it's july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I'm BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It's like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what I want to do.

But I just sit here. Heck, if I'm procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that's at least fun! But I'm still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feels like it's too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I'm paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time.

It doesn't help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I'm constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it's taking so much space in my head although I'm quite 'close to my goal', and I shouldn't even worry because if I keep doing what I planned (restrict for another 4-5 weeks, then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health), there's no reason to be so occupied with this topic.

Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of can't do anything about.


PLEASE don't suggest to get professional help. I know, it's the most rational thing, especially for the eating thing, but right now, I just can't, I really can't :(",1
"Best friend of 7 years dropped me like nothing.
So I'm in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to visit where I live for the first time. It was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together. So I took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on. After my visit with him at her house, I asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because I third wheeled her in her own house. However, I don't feel we did that because we weren't affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well. A little after he left I apologize to her even though I didn't feel I had done anything wrong. Recently, she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if Imma be honest... I don't care. 

Yes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel. I think there was a jealousy element to it but I'll never know. Because I'm not chasing her, she's gotta come to me.

My girlfriend lives in Michigan I live in Oklahoma I want to introduce her to my mom but I don't know how",0
"Too cowardice or just selfish?
So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now.
There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch.

So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one.

So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend.

(you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry)

The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew it, I was being a control freak, I hated the other one not out of jealousy, but rather because she brought her down - her girlfriend was suicidal, she kept saying how she wanted to die - well I could careless about that because I knew lovers don't like bestfriends. That is, until she started saying how she wanted to die, she was constantly whining, crying and whether I asked her she just said nothing was wrong and kept on doing so. And whether I tried to talk some sense into her she just replied with a single ""Ok."" and it was bugging me. And she spent most of her time talking to her girlfriend and kinda just went anywhere with her, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore at this point. Now I'm not that small to start hating her for that, I let it slide anyways, though it bugged the hell out of me. So as you all know how important your last year of highschool is, she kind of just felt so down she lost a great deal of weight but it's kinda weird how I started to careless about details, about her too, of course, guessing because I was let down so many times. But anyways, my feelings for her started to fade, but regardless, I still tried to cheer her up, pushing her to study but she gave me the cold shoulders and even got mad at me for ""interfering"" with her life. And ever since we talked less. Then lately I don't know what is wrong with me but I just started feeling hatred for her. I didn't even blame myself for that. I just...Hated her. But for some reasons, I can't quite tell her and I don't even know why, why our distance grew and why I loved her and now I hate her.

Is it strange?",0
"Relationship with my Dad
Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him.

I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. 

My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue.

He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. 

It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. 

Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. 

Thank you.",0

My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). 

I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time.

I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories.

"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements.
Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. 

Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. 

Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. 

You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.

Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

"My dad died today
So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month. 

Today my dad died at 42. 

He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. 

My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. 

I was there to see a fresh dead corpse. 

My dad. My *dad.*

To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch.

Hello I am 17 and live in the state of PA... I will be turning 18 soon and I plan on moving out of my dad’s house to move in with my mom and change schools for my senior year. I essentially plan on cutting complete contact with him as he has outlived his usefulness and we have not got along anyway however I do have a few questions I wanna bring up that some of you may be able to answer.

- He is currently in possession of important documentation I don’t want him to have such as various copies of important things like birth certificate, social security, medical stuff, etc. I plan on swiping these anyway from him. However, I want to know if he can legally withhold the info from me.

-Can he ever at anytime get copies of various personally information of mine without me knowing or without my consent as an adult?

-He said in the past you are still a minor if one is still in high-school. This is probably a stupid question but I will ask it.

-When I go to enroll into a new high-school would I need anyone or since I am 18 could I just do it myself.

These are just a few a the questions I have and will probably make a follow up post In the future if anymore questions I come across need to be answers or can at least get feedback.

So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I don’t have many friends and that’s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason.

While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names.

"My friend is a douchebag
I don’t know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the “leader” of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, he’s extremely rude. I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends. I can’t even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just don’t have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited. By the way I’m in high school. ",0
"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend?
HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me

So this is the situation: 
My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. 

The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. 

So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. 

I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation. ",0
"Crashing In
Sorry this is long.

I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4.  I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery.

I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close.  She became a reason to live.  Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot.   Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true.  So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help.  They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide.

Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning.

Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. 

The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days.

In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. 

I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed.

I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low.

Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story.

I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. 

I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really.  I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone. 

Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated.  Thank you.",1
"I've been having suicidal thoughts more than ever...
I feel like I fail at everything, I don't have any motivation to clean or really do anything. I feel like I'm no good at anything and have gotten really lazy.
I'm not the best wife and I've made many mistakes. If i asked my husband to do something and he didn't I'd complain to try and get help. If he's not doing anything I wouldn't either. Now that he's moved out I feel like I don't really have any reason to live.
I used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago cause I got arrested (on my anniversary) and am facing felony charges on something that's legal. I've had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean.
I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so I would always refuse depression meds. I've heard mixed things about them, and I'm scared on how they would take effect on me. 
But since the arrest I've been getting progressively worse and worse. My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever. One of the biggest reasons I haven't been able to bring myself to doing it again is I care for others more than myself. I couldn't hurt my friends and family like that but I'm mentally going insane...",1

"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die
From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope

When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. 

Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.

Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. 

I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both. 
Depression sucks, that's a fact we all know, but suicide is not the way to go. There is always another way, at least that is what I like to think",1
"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance
So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. 

My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity.

Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism.  Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable  around him at times.

 My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. 

My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active.

 It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll  include children right away, but just my fiance and I. 

When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. 

I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. 

I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. 

I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.",0
"How I'm coping with the end of a friendship...
I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.)

So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore.

She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. 

I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way.

Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her.

For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday.

(This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.)

After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her.

In sum, I just decided to protect myself. ",0

"Friend Abandonment Issues
Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now.
Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it.
Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing.
Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed.
As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear about how some other casual friends keep in touch with each other still and give each other life advice etc. and just feel frustrated that I can't keep consistent good friends like that. What am I doing wrong?",0

I raised him to have traditional white European values and to be proud of his race and heritage, I was always convinced he took this on board, but I hadn’t seen my son in three years after an disagreement, so I checked his Facebook and I saw pictures of him on his wedding day with a Mexican as a bride and I almost fainted I was so upset, I feel utterly betrayed, I just found this out yesterday and I don’t know how to confront him, I think it’s really gross that he lays with a mud skinned woman in bed every night, I wanted white grandchildren I could love, but if he has kids with this thing I want nothing to do with them, I feel so utterly betrayed, what should I do?",0
"Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction
Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode.


No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.


My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. 


I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it.

What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help.",1

"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown
I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time.

"I don't know if I am allowed to feel this way
I don't have many friends to start with. I mean I do, but when I count close friends, I nearly have none as I am slowly starting to lose them. I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don't feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with ""sorry I'm busy with homework"" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn't say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don't even care or want to even care about me anymore because I'm the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else. 

On top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I'm going to be told ""no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals"" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn't like that. But please, my request is may I have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation? My point of view I feel is too biased because I already know the person and their habits and I have an emotional response to this. ",0
"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce?
Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background.  

My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby.

Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year.

Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again.

I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life.

If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again.

I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.",0
"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life
Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much.

My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me.

I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely.

I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe.

I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take.",1
"I do want to live...just not like this.
I remember when I used to be so happy at the world. Full of opportunities, believed that you could be anything you wanted, yadda yadda yadda...

I can't stand how much of a failure I am, and how mediocre I am. I'm the ugly friend and women ignore me. Online dating is a joke. I hate my body with a burning passion. I'm bad at everything I do. Every attempt to feel positive is met with a ""no! you can't feel like this, and here's why"". It's like my brain is set to the ""negative"" setting by default, and I can't change it. Then I just give up and let myself succumb to the self-hate.

Just wish I wasn't so damn shit. Wish I wasn't ugly. Wish I had a body I was proud of. Wish women didn't look down on me like I have the plague. Wish I had something to be proud of.",1

"My Friend is Draining Me
Apologies, this is a very long post!

I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD.

She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication.

Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems.

I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship.

The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. 

I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. 

Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone.

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay
It’s been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasn’t been the easiest for him. 

We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldn’t bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he’s had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I don’t blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. 

I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either don’t actually gaf or they have their own problems and I don’t want to add on to their burdens. It’s also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxiety—something I’m trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It’s you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I’ve had terrible insomnia since coming home). 

I’m still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad. 

I’ve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I’m not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I’m in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like I’m floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time.

"Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help?
No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...


I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.


We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...

"My friend is ruining her frienships
I'm not really sure what to do here.
My best friend, let's call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she's lost almost every close friendship she's ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she'd declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it's Sam's fault that the friendships are crumbling.
Recently, she's started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she'd be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn't view her as a friend.
She's started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn't eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven't spoken since.
And unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can't make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn't continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn't want to be friends.
Worst of all, she accuses people of saying things they've never said, claiming that she's stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn't matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel.
It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She's in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with ""being such a failure"" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship.
I want to be there for her. I want to help. She's been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I'm not sure I can handle who she's become and how she's started treating us.
tl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She's getting therapeutic help but I'm not sure I'm able to stick around long enough for things to get better.",0

They are one of the best friends I have ever gotten. And only friends as for now too, since I find it really difficult to make friends, and to keep an stable relationship without screwing it up even thought what I value the most in my life is my friends.
As of the last 2 months they have been unactive (We only talk online and see each other from time to time), not talking to me, saying they get bored of our conversation, never starting a conversation. 
And never consider to invite me to hangout, they just do it for themselves. I'm not sure how to feel anymore, when I am in person with them we have tons of fun, and sometimes when we talk the conversations are really interesting and fun too.

I always feel uneasy and not comfortable about them... So what should I do?

I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down.  ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them?

"Things that I liked about today so far
**Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude.
Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.""


I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.

I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.

I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.

I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing.

I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.

I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.

I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.

I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.

I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind.

I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.",1
"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place
Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. 

Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way. ",1

It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly... Not going out or not doing xyz; because I'm unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse. 

I feel like I know who I am when I'm well and I'm never awake at 5 am or failing a piece of work etc. But do I allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder? Letting it be an excuse? I've no way to tell really. I think I've been depressed so long now that I can't even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing.

"Should I still communicate with my father?
Hello everyone. So the past few days my mom caught my dad cheating on her (2 women specifically). Now my mom sent him a closure to cut the ties (we live on the US while my dad is on another country). I'm angry and familiar with this feeling as well because my previous girlfriend cheated on me too (I guess it runs on the blood to be cheated on).

Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her.

"Beautifully Broken
I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me.

But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist.

Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself.

At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse.

By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. 
Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with.

Would I do it?

Could I do it?

Would anyone care?

I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay.

My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay.

They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken.

It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place.

The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is.

I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there.

And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences.

This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this.

I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you.
I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care.

Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness.

It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different.

And maybe I am crazy, I’m sure as hell different, but that doesn’t make me any less of a person. I’m proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I’m not going to stop chasing it.

"Friends keep making fun of me?
Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken.

I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie.

But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this.

I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend).

I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me.

Can anyone help me?",0
"I want to kill myself a lot these days
I’m just so disconnected from everything and everyone. I can’t meet new people, and it is making me hate my life. The only girls I meet are through work, and I’d rather keep these relationships professional. Girls I meet other ways never last, and I don’t know how to stop talking to them. I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen. 

I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones. 

I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition. I don’t even realize it, it’s all subconscious. I’m an asshole and I’ve just been a dick to people who just don’t deserve it. I’ve been so selfish. 

I guess I can be happy that I’ve started to make changes. They say change your habits and your mind will follow. Well I’ve improved my habits greatly over the past year, so why am I still a piece of shit. Why am I still unable to let go of the failed relationships. Why am I unable to move forward from all this.

Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad.

Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this ""you are bad"" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere.

Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do?

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis
I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really. 

Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. 

The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. 

My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt. 

When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. 

The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. 

It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. 

My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.  

I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. 

I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.  

A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. 

I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. 

I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. 

A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn't even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded ""Most likely to make camp happen by himself"". I was awarded ""Linger"", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating. 
At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.

I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I'd ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back. 

I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I'd ever met, and I couldn't take him any more. 

I've spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I'm no closer than when I started. I've been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I've been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me. 

So, that's where I am. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad's cancer even younger than he did. ",1
"Lonely, family/friends just not interested??
We moved across the country almost a year ago. We left all our extended family behind, which was hard because we were really close to them. But, It was a great opportunity for us. We are doing really well as a family unit, with life, jobs, and everything other than missing our family.

Now, I'm getting really lonely, and can't seem to get any of my in laws or friends to come visit, even the ones with no jobs, kids, whatever. Tried offering to pay for the airfare.

"Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone
I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me.

Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think.

I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should.

I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide.

I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice.

Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources.

TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illness",1
"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member
This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do.

So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) .

Anyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem.""

That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. 
My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. 

I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) 

They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. 

My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. 

My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) 

My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure.

 I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. 

To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. 

I am asking regarding this situation, what should I do and what advice do you suggest for dealing with toxic family members who make fun of your dreams and put obstacles in your way to hold you back from succeeding ? Also getting the account number off of the bill after the bill comes --- how good of an idea is that?",0
"I don’t even want to write this post
I just wish I had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did. But instead I got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who I regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when I was younger. Im the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life. This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks. I don’t even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts I’m always having about whether or not I believe or don’t believe that this life is worth living. I’m trying every single day, I’m trying my hardest to keep it together, I’m trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but I am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that I don’t even want to fucking live.",1

I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time being— I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated. 

And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking. ",1

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic?
Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.

All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.

This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people?

Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.",1

"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why
My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time.
Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong.  
That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.  ",0

"I'm Weakest At Night...
I don't understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I've always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy... 



Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness...



And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate.

In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort.

"I have no idea what to do
My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts.

The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up.

Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.

Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life. ",1

Hello to the community,
I feel like I’m lost and alone that no one can help me.
It started when I was around 15 and now I’m 20.
I can’t sleep at the night, my head is so full of think everything and nothing at the same time. I just wanna run away from everything from everybody.
I don’t have Plans for my future job, I’m studying at a college and don’t even know what to do after that.

"Am I being too harsh?
I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend.  We used to do everything together.  Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together.  About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices.  Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people.  At first, it didn't really affect our friendship.  We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out.  It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up.  One weekend, the whole friendship imploded.  

Some of my friends were coming into town.  Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us.  Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun.  Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations.  They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him.  That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours.  I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out.  He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine.  I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions.  I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did.  After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar.

The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown.  Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right.  I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party).  Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities.  She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life.  Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking.  I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate.

That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event.  We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text.  He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying.  She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him.  I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail.  At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior.  Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this?  I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away.  Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police.  They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail.  I refuse.  Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night.

It's been over a year since I've talked to him.  I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him.

My question:  Am I being too harsh?  Treating him like this breaks my heart.  He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings.  I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this.",0
"I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people don’t seek out professional help
I don’t know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants’ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It’s pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it’s “for crazies”.

I’ve been chronically depressed for years but I’m finally going to seek professional help Monday. I’ve been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, I’ll be damned if they feel they can’t come to me to talk about any bad thoughts. ",1

"""You don't have it bad enough""/""You only think about yourself""
Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety. They told me I don’t have it bad enough and if I were worse off I’d get my shit together. So something in me snaps and I admit I’d actually rather be dead (whoops).

"I'm going to the party
Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret""  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. 

That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. 

This pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can't speak up for herself. She died  7 yr's ago. 

My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. 

This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. 

Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.

 Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. 

That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? 

So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. 

My aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?! 

 Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. 

My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. 

The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. 

Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. 

Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy.

So yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us. 

So now I'm about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it's the right thing to do. Give me strength mom and dad!",0
"I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction.
Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong.

Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends.

I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall.

I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like. 

In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience.

I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.

"I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything
Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight. 

Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. 

I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I’m trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can’t be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me.

I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything.

I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity.

"Ideas for sleep?
Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better?

TL;DR Sleep is elusive, i want to sleep more than anything. Please help. ",1
"All my friends have left me behind
My best friends at school got new computers that can run AAA games and it was my idea. They soon all got gta and im stuck with this laptop. After this things started going downhill. i wasnt getting added to skype calls, when i asked, they said ""gta players only"" and when i slipped in one time i asked ""when are you guys ever going to play with me again"" either they didnt say anything or said ""i dont know"" and then one of my friends said ""we will play with you at school"". I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that. Thats why im reaching out here. what should i do? im so scared and confused.",1
"Sick of this
I'm tired of being the one that always has to write to people.. if I wouldn't do that, I feel that they won't talk to me until they need me to do something for them. I hate that I always get so attached to the people I bond with.. and what sucks more is the fact that I feel this thing is not reciprocal. ",0
"My latest addiction for pain relief
Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate.


If you feel like you've given up and don't care about anything, give this a try. If you truly don't care then you'll at least get to feel the comforting touch of another human. ",1
"How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin?
I have a brother who people call ""retarded"". But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that. 
When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. 
At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of. 
He's been living an easy life 'cause people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done. And none would want to resent him making mistakes 'cause ""he's retarded, just leave him"" they say. I envy him. Should I be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents? ",0
"Just found out my mum is pregnant. Advice on big age gaps between siblings would be appreciated.
I have two younger sisters, and we're all really close in age (my youngest sister is 3 years younger than me), but I'm turning 20 this year. So this new baby will be 20 years younger than me. 

I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother.

If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you. ",0
"What's wrong with me?
I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated. ",1
"The life as an adult is soul crushingly lonely and isolating
Seriously, it feels like it gets a lot more difficult to make friends. My best friend moved out of state and I realized I have nobody now. Everybody else I knew back in college/high school is working, has a SO or has kids to take care of.  I’m just tired of feeling so isolated and not a priority for anyone.",1
"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life?
I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle.

I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it?

Thanks for reading.",1
"I’m so alone...
I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try. ",1
"Today is my 45th birthday.
Today is my 45th birthday.
Being 45 doesn't bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years.
I've spent the last 20 years lost in depression.
I'm tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated.
I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed.
People ask if I am suicidal, and my answer is, ""I'm open to the possibility.""
People ask if I'm planning, and I say, ""No, not actively. I've already planned it out.""
I can't understand why I am still here nor do I understand why I stay.

"Odd number of children
Some people have been telling me that if you choose to have more then one child that you should keep the number of children to an even number or there will always be an odd man out.

"Do you ever feel like you can't do anything right and everyone secretly hates you?
I've felt like that for as long as I can remember, and it feels like no matter how many times people tell me it's not true, I can't convince myself that I'm not a worthless waste of human existence and that everyone doesn't see me for the shitty person that I am. How can anyone else like me if I don't even like myself? I'll always be alone with only my parents caring about me because they feel obligated to and they probably don't think I could function without them. Even with them, I can barely function. ",1
"I'm tired of forcing myself to do things.
Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD.

I don't know. 

All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*. 

I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation. 

I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun...

How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works? 

Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep. ",1
